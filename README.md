# School Notification Server
This system provides a UI for teachers to request students through an internet radio system.
This server would host an icecast internet radio stream and transmit to listeners. The icecast gets fed the main audio output of the computer. On the web server I have developed a main interface which uses PHP to send commands to the server machine which then uses a text to speech system.
